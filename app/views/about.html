<p>Tandem is a foreign language app that focuses on practice through asyncronous speaking and listening.  While most existing tandem programs focuse on connecting learners with individual tandem partners, this app allows learners to practice with the entire Tandem network, at any time, without having to commit to a specific partner or a specific time schedule.</p>
